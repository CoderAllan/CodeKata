# CodeKata

*See below for an explanation of 'CodeKata'*

## Triangle classification

Write a program that determines the type of a triangle.

* It should take the lengths of the triangle's three sides as input, and return whether the triangle is equilateral, isosceles or scalene (*Danish translation: ligesidede, ligebenet eller scalene*).
* Also consider tests, documentation and/or errors.
* You can use a language of your own choice.

### Approaches

#### Simplistic
The validation and classification is done by simple if-statements.

#### Object oriented
The validation and classification is done by using object oriented techniques.
