# Triangle classification

Write a program that determines the type of a triangle.

* It should take the lengths of the triangle's three sides as input, and return whether the triangle is equilateral, isosceles or scalene (*Danish translation: ligesidede, ligebenet eller scalene*).
* Also consider tests, documentation and/or errors.
* You can use a language of your own choice.

## Approaches

### Simplistic
The validation and classification is done by simple if-statements. (C#)

### Object oriented
The validation and classification is done by using object oriented techniques. (C#)

### Multithreaded
The validation and classification is done in parallel using multithreading. (C#)

### ReactJS
The classification is implemented in javascript and using ReactJS for presentation

### jQuery
