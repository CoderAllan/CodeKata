# Javascript implementations

I have made some different implementations of the triangle classification using javascript. And for the UI specific parts of the implementations i have used the following javascript frameworks:

* jQuery
* ReactJS

## Approaches

### Simplistic
The validation and classification is implemented using simple if-statements. 

### Object oriented
The validation and classification is implemented using object oriented techniques.
